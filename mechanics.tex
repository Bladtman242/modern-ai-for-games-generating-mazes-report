The algorithm is not designed towards any specific game or game mechanics, but it is worth discussing how different mechanics will affect how the algorithm should be configured. 

This section will go through a few examples of some common game mechanics and what metrics can help determine if a level is suited for a game with such mechanics. For every point it is worth keeping in mind that the criteria will very depending on the specific game mechanics.

\subsection{Cops and Robbers}

The first broad category we'll discuss is cops and robbers games. Some specific genres in this category are stealth, heist, and horror games, and some arcade games, such as Pacman, in which you have to avoid enemies while reaching your goal.

Some of the key metric in evaluating if a level is good for cops and robbers are: cul-de-sacs and cycles. The effect of each depends highly on the specific game mechanics, but in general we want cyclic levels with multiple cycles and a few dead ends to place objectives at.

Cul-de-sacs are generally not encouraged, because they can easily guarantee a loss for the player if they are caught there. A few short dead ends are useful for placement of objectives or as red herrings. 

Inversely cycles are an advantage for the player, as it ensures that they have an escape route. If the game has limited visibility, then cycles work even better because the player can still run into the cops if they don't know they're there.


\subsection{Dungeon Crawlers}

The second category we will work with is dungeon crawlers. Examples of these are the Zelda games, Binding of Issac, and Skyrim.

The key metrics this time around are subtrees and choke-points. Dungeons typically have branching paths and few cycles. Any cycles are typically used for backtracking. Choke-points are edges in the graph that connect two otherwise separated components, and are important for objectives, such as locked doors and help make the dungeon more linear.


\subsection{Theme and style}

There are a lot of features that are left to the theme and style of the game. Symmetry for example doesn't have a clear purpose other creating a specific style of maze.
