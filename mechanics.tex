The algorithm is not designed towards any specific game or game mechanics, but it is worth discussing how different mechanics will affect how the algorithm should be configured. 

This section will go through a few examples of some common game mechanics and what metrics can help determine if a level is suited for a game with such mechanics. For every point it is worth keeping in mind that the criteria will very depending on the specific game mechanics.

\subsection{Cops and Robbers}

The first broad category we'll discuss is cops and robbers games. Some specific genres in this category are stealth, heist, and horror games, and some arcade games, such as Pacman, in which you have to avoid enemies while reaching your goal.



Cop-win, some cul-de-sacs, low pitfalls, high cycle length?


\subsection{Dungeon Crawlers}

Examples:
Zelda, Binding of Issac

Choke-points?, cul-de-sacs, few cycles


\subsection{Theme}

Symmetry? Visual things?
