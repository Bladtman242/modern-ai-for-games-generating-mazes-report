Procedurally generation of levels that are well designed and don't break immersion is a common problem in game development. This is especially true for roguelikes which heavily rely on procedural content to keep the player engaged \cite{6Procedu79:online, BerlinIn39:online}. The specific approach varies from game to game, and only a few algorithms are simple and generic enough to be reused across projects.

This paper will introduce an algorithm that takes concepts from several other algorithms and puts it together in a new way. Specifically, the algorithm behaves like graph-grammars, but are applied to a lattice, so they some of the spatial properties of L-systems or cellular automata. We will therefore call this method Lattice-grammars.

We will go through what the algorithm is based on and how it works, before defining some test cases and evaluating the results.
